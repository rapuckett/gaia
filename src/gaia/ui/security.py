"""Cross-origin request defenses for the Agent UI backend.

The backend binds loopback and has no authentication while the tunnel is
off, so any web page the user visits could drive it. Three layers close
that off, all applied in middleware so a route added tomorrow is covered
without its author remembering anything:

1. **CSRF header** -- every mutating (non-GET/HEAD/OPTIONS) request to
   ``/api/*`` or ``/v1/*`` must carry ``X-Gaia-UI: 1``. A page cannot set
   a custom header on a cross-origin request without a CORS preflight,
   and the app's CORS policy approves preflights only from its own
   first-party dev origins.
2. **Origin allowlist** -- a mutating request whose ``Origin`` names
   somewhere other than this server, loopback, or the live tunnel is
   refused outright, so a CORS misconfiguration alone is not enough.
3. **Host allowlist** -- DNS rebinding needs a *hostname* that resolves
   to loopback, so a ``Host`` that is neither an IP literal, nor
   loopback, nor the live tunnel is refused.

``Origin: null`` and a missing ``Origin`` are accepted: the packaged
Electron shell serves the SPA from ``file://`` (an opaque origin) and
non-browser callers send no ``Origin`` at all. Neither can be produced by
a cross-site page that *also* carries ``X-Gaia-UI`` -- layer 1 stops
those, and a sandboxed iframe's ``null``-origin preflight is refused by
CORS before the real request is ever sent.
